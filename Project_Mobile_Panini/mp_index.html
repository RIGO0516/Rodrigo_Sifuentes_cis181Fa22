        <p><strong>Mobile Panini</strong>is the culmination of the dream of Antonio and
            <br />Carmen Dolcini, who came to America looking to serve people the
            <br />authentic recipes learned from their Sicilian family.
        </p>
        <p>Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he
            learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his
            technique at the Culinary Institute of Milan. His younger brother,
            Carmen, with no less of a love for cooking and good food, also
            worked in the deli and became well-acquainted with the open-air
            fresh food markets of his home town. Carmen too, is a proud
            graduate of the Culinary Institute of Milan.</p>
        <p>Now you can enjoy what they have learned and mastered, right outside
            your door; but with no compromises in freshness or delicacy of preparation.

            four wheels - from the East and the West!</p>
